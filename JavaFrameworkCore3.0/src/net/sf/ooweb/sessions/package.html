<body>
	This package defines the Session management in OOWeb.  A SessionFactory
	and the abstract Session class may be used by client code in order to
	implement different session management strategies.
	<p/>
	OOWeb has a built-in replicated session which will automatically
	find other instances of OOWeb running on the same subnet and join
	the cluster.
